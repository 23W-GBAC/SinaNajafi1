# Water
Hello everyone,

this blog is about the importance of water and some new ways to overcome lack of water in the world (especially in Africa and Asia).
Chemically, Water is a transparent colorless chemical substance with one oxygen atom covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms. Water is needed for various purposes every day. Just like there is no life without oxygen, there is no existence without water. It exists in the form of seas, oceans, etc., and also in the form of ice.

Approximately 71% of the global population had access to improved water sources (2022). Improved water sources include piped water, boreholes, protected wells, and rainwater collection. But, the percentage of people with access to safely managed drinking water services, ensuring water is not only available but also free from contamination, is lower. Access to safely managed drinking water varies significantly by region and country.

Nowadays, water is accessible easily, and maybe this is the reason why people pay less attention how to use water correctly. However, warnings about water consumption have made people a little conscious about the situation. In fact, about 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, predominantly in the form of oceans. However, only around 2.5% of Earth's water is a freshwater, and the majority of that is locked in glaciers and ice caps. This leaves a relatively small percentage, roughly 0.3%, available as surface water in lakes, rivers, and swamps. Of this accessible freshwater, not all is suitable for drinking due to contamination and pollution. The amount of readily drinkable water is a fraction of the total freshwater resources, highlighting the importance of water conservation and sustainable usage.

Agriculture is the sector that uses the most water globally. Irrigation for crops, including rice paddies and other water-intensive crops, accounts for a significant portion of water consumption. It varies regionally, with water-intensive agriculture playing a particularly substantial role in areas with large-scale farming.

In some regions, industries such as manufacturing and energy production also contribute significantly to water usage. Additionally, domestic water use, including residential consumption and municipal services, plays a role, but it generally constitutes a smaller share compared to agriculture and certain industrial processes.

Compared to agriculture, household usage (washing, drinking, etc.) is not playing significant role in water consumption.
Efforts to manage water resources sustainably often focus on improving water use efficiency in agriculture, adopting water-saving technologies in industries, and promoting water conservation practices in households.

Here are some innovative strategies to overcome the barrier:

### 1. Desalination Technology:
 Advancements in desalination, which extracts salt and impurities from seawater, offer a potential solution to increase freshwater supplies.

### 2. Water Harvesting:
 Implementing rainwater harvesting systems in urban and rural areas can help capture and store rainwater for various uses, reducing reliance on traditional sources.

### 3. Smart Irrigation:
 Utilizing precision agriculture techniques and smart irrigation systems can optimize water use in farming, reducing wastage and improving crop yields.

### 4. Water Recycling and Reuse:
 Promoting the recycling and reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable purposes, such as irrigation and industrial processes, helps conserve freshwater resources.

### 5. Cloud Seeding:
 Cloud seeding involves inducing rain by dispersing substances into the air to stimulate cloud condensation. While still under research, it's a technology with potential for localized water augmentation.

### 6. Drip Irrigation in Agriculture:
 Precision irrigation methods like drip irrigation deliver water directly to the roots of plants, minimizing water loss and increasing efficiency in agriculture.

### 7. Afforestation and Watershed Management:
 Planting trees and implementing watershed management practices help protect and replenish water sources by preventing soil erosion and maintaining ecosystem balance.

### 8. Innovative Water Storage:
 Developing advanced water storage technologies, such as underground aquifer storage and smart reservoirs, can enhance water availability during dry periods.

### 9. Water-Saving Technologies:
Encouraging the adoption of water-efficient appliances, fixtures, and  industrial processes can significantly reduce water consumption in households and industries.

### Why We Don’t Use Ocean Water?    
    
Probably, people will think about desalination, when we talk about a solution for lack of water, because desalination is the answer of question (Why we don’t use ocean water?).

While desalination provides a reliable and consistent source of freshwater, it may not universally be considered the most reliable option due to factors such as high costs, energy intensity, and environmental impact. Its suitability as the primary solution depends on specific regional needs and conditions. In many cases, a balanced approach that includes desalination along with other water sources and sustainable practices is recommended for a resilient water supply system.

Finally, By combining these cutting-edge technologies with efficient policies and global cooperation, there is potential to mitigate water scarcity and ensure a more sustainable future for water resources. Raising awareness about water conservation practices and promoting community involvement can lead to sustainable water management practices at the grassroots level.
