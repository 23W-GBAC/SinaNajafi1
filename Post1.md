# Security Systems Nowadays 

Hello people, this blog is about “security” in information field and diverse security systems.

Security by its own definition is the state of being free from danger or threat. It seems this concept is being forgotten among people over the time and is becoming like a normal stereotype. This concept has integrated with technology overtime and today it is a complex network around the world in different fields.

Since the beginning of the humanity, people were looking for security to establish a peaceful life within their country, city and their home. Of course, looking for security has led to massive wars between nations throughout history.

### From ancient Egyptian’s security guards to Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML):

We can go back in time to see early examples in the Ancient Egyptian Pharaohs who hired private security guards for personal protection. Also, Thomas Jefferson in 1795 created the Jefferson disk or wheel cypher, which was a secure method to encode and decode messages. Today, Artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled security systems to learn and adapt to changing threats. Security technology helps mitigate risk by preventing unauthorized access, identifying potential incidents, allowing fast responses, deterring criminal behavior and capturing crucial evidence in the event that a breach occurs.

Now, here you can see some of the most advanced security systems, which, is being used widely around the world. These advanced security systems contribute to a multi-layered defense strategy, addressing various aspects of modern cyber security challenges:
### 1. Biometric Access Control:
   - Utilizes unique biological traits (fingerprint, iris scan, facial recognition) for authentication.
   - Provides a higher level of security compared to traditional methods like passwords.
     
     This is a valid authentication method and it is mostly used in embassies. For example: Biometric Photo and Biometric Fingerprint.

### 2. AI-Powered Threat Detection:
   - Uses artificial intelligence to analyze patterns and detect anomalies in network traffic or user behavior.
   - Enables proactive identification of potential security threats.
     
AI-Powered Threat Detection is AI is utilized in various ways to detect and prevent cyber threats.

### 3. Blockchain Security:
   - Utilizes decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger technology.
   - Enhances data integrity and prevents unauthorized alterations.
### 4. Zero Trust Architecture:
   - Assumes no trust, even within the internal network.
   - Requires continuous authentication and authorization for every user and device.
     
Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cyber security paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. Zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows.

### 5. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):
   - Monitors and responds to advanced threats at the endpoint level.
   - Provides real-time visibility into endpoint activities for swift response.
     
When it identifies a threat, it alerts your team so they can triage, investigate, and rectify the incident before it has the chance to become a full-blown breach.

### 6. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR):
   - Integrates security tools and automates incident response processes.
   - Improves efficiency and response time in handling security incidents.
     
As we know improvement in automation equals to progress in efficiency. Automation can also applied in security systems.

### 7. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):
   - Ensures secure configuration of cloud services.
   - Monitors and manages security risks in cloud environments.
     
In cloud environments- like VMware horizon- it detects and prevents the misconfigurations and threats that lead to sensitive data breaches and compliance violations.

### 8. Threat Intelligence Platforms:
   - Aggregates and analyzes threat data from various sources.
   - Provides insights into emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
   - These platforms play a crucial role in helping organization stay informed about latest threats.
   
Some Threat Intelligence Platforms are:

   -IBM X-Force Exchange: Provides threat intelligence sharing and collaboration and provides a database of threat indicators and vulnerabilities.
   
   -Anomali ThreatStream: Offers orchestration and automation for threat response.
   
   -Cisco Talos Intelligence: Gives threat intelligence for Cisco security products. Also, offers updates on the latest threat.
   
### 9. Network Traffic Analysis (NTA):
   - Examines network traffic to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
   - Enhances visibility into network behavior for better threat detection.
   
Collecting a real-time and historical record of what's happening on your network.

### 10. Quantum-Safe Cryptography:
 - Prepares for the potential threat of quantum computers breaking current encryption.
 - Implements cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum attacks.
    
Quantum-safe cryptography refers to efforts to identify algorithms that are resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers, to keep information assets secure even after a large-scale quantum computer has been built.

Nowadays, you can see how security systems are growing and this progress is being more and more complex and widespread overtime. Obviously, this is because we live in information age, as a result, the need for security in information is compulsory.
