First post is about the security systems in the field of information. Given that my study program is related to data and information area I decided to write about this field. Idea of this subject driven by concerns about cyber security, privacy and protect sensitive information.
Security was always an important need for human being and considering that we are at information age, security is indispensible for all aspects of our life in this age. Currently, there are lots of cyber security challenges. So, information security was my first choice.

Second post’s subject is video games. Personally, video games are one of my entertainments, although I’m not professional gamer.
 In the second post, I mentioned some topics about the subject.  Given that video games are a major part of my entertainment, I tried to focus mostly on benefits rather than negative side. Topics are about the relation of video games with profession, education and technology. Also some advantages and disadvantages.

Third post is simply about water and management of this vital substance. Due to the lack of water in my country I thought this subject is so related and important for me. Also, there are water scarcity challenges in many countries on the earth, so I found this subject indispensible and related.
 I mentioned some of innovative strategies to overcome the barrier, for example, desalination technology. Also, there is a chart about water consumption worldwide and freshwater on the planet to show the importance of this substance.

Given that I’m piano performer and my program has a relation with health, my fourth post is about impact of music on mental health.
 Actually, I tried to mention the importance of this impact in a scientific way. Stress before the exams was always an important issue for me. In fourth page I mentioned some examples that how a classic music can fade your stress over the time. I found this subject a great choice as it allows exploration of the emotional and psychological impact of music.
